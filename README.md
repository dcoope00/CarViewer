<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In an effort to build more full stack applications and increase my understanding of full stack web development, I have made a simple car viewer that utilizes React.js in combination with Next.js. It includes features such as file-based routing, api routing for adding new cars to the database, and page pre-rendering. MongoDB is also used to add and retrieve data from a database and environment variables are used to hide credentials. Details for each car in the list are fetched dynamically on click of the "Show Details" button using dynamic routing. I have documented all Next.js specific functionality in the code.
